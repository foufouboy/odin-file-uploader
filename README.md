# TOP File Uploader Project

## Using :
(mainly)
- HTML/CSS/JS
- Typescript
- Passport
- Prisma ORM
- Tailwind
- Express
- PostgresSQL
- Pug

## Goal :
Creating a simple and clean multi-page app where users can authenticate, upload and manage files in a folder-based system.

This project serves as a full-stack app to train all of what we learnt so far in the NodeJS part of the course; at this point I added Tailwind, Typescript and Prisma ORM to the stack, so I'll practice that, and Passport which I've not yet put my head all around.

I'll try to make that app efficiently and cleanly, separating the front from the back, commiting regularly, and defining my tasks to know where I start and when I finish in my code sessions.
