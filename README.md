# Express base template

This repo serves as a base template for my express apps, using Pug for the front part. It mainly focus on providing
a MVC folder structure, setting-up default files that will always be used, and the libraries/frameworks that I will use.
It includes, for example, utilities for authentication (passport-js), form validation (express-validation), and various useful dev
dependancies. 

This rep will be updated regularly to better fit my needs.

### Main used technologies :
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- Pug
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Prisma ORM
- NodeJS
